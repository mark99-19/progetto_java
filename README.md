A simple Java project about a Data Prevention Loss software, created for the Computer Programming course exam at University of Milan.
Creators: Marco Falzone (mark99-19) and Massimo Negroni (arcadia).

The project's goal is to understand main properties of an Object Oriented Programming language like Java.

There are two packages, and also much work to do in order to improve it...
When the Main class starts, it creates a SFTP connection to a server. After that, there's a CLI login page: data typed here (e-mail address and password) are checked on a remotely SQL server.
Password is hashed with SHA-512 - we know that's an unsecure option, but in this project's step, that's just a proof of concept -

Feel free to pull request if you want to collaborate or improving it better!

Thank you
Marco
